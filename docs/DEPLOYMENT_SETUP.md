# Deployment Setup

This document details what is needed to create an environment to run FormSG in AWS.

## Build and run your NodeJS app

```bash
npm install
$ npm run build
$ npm start
```

## Deploying to AWS Elastic Beanstalk

Make sure you have created an AWS cloud environment as a prerequisite. Some of the services used are listed below:

Infrastructure

- AWS Elastic Beanstalk / EC2 for hosting and deployment
- AWS Elastic File System for mounting files (i.e. SingPass/MyInfo private keys into the `/certs` directory)
- AWS S3 for image and logo hosting, attachments for Storage Mode forms
- AWS Service Manager - Parameter Store, for holding environment variable configuration

DevOps

- Github Actions for running tests and builds
- AWS Elastic Container Registry to host built Docker images

Network

- AWS VPC (with peering preferred) for managed database hosted by MongoDB Atlas
- AWS NAT Gateway (for static IP whitelisting with SingPass)

Database

- MongoDB instance (we use Mongo Atlas)

Emails

- AWS Simple Email Service with SMTP integration for sending emails to login/send OTPs/form submissions/submission autoreplies

SMS

- Twilio for sending OTPs
- AWS Secrets Manager (to manage user-provided or hosted Twilio credentials)

Analytics and Monitoring

- Sentry.io
- Google Analytics

Spam protection

- Google reCAPTCHA

### Mounting Elastic File System into Docker container on Elastic Beanstalk

Please see [Dockerrun.aws.json](../Dockerrun.aws.json). This file is required for SingPass/MyInfo/CorpPass functionality to be enabled.

### Secrets Manager (Optional)

FormSG supports storing of users' Twilio API credentials using AWS Secret Manager. There is currently no user interface for form administrators to upload their Twilio API credentials and this has to be done manually using the AWS console by developers.

Firstly, name the secret with a unique secret name and store the secret value in the following format:

```json
{
  "accountSid": "<redacted>",
  "apiKey": "<redacted>",
  "apiSecret": "<redacted>",
  "messagingServiceSid": "<redacted>"
}
```

Secondly, edit the form document belonging to that specific form adminstrator by adding a `msgSrvcName` key and setting it to the secret name you just stored.

If no `msgSrvcName` is found in the form document, SMSes associated with that form will be sent out using and charged to the default Twilio API credentials.

### Github Actions Secrets

The following repository secrets are set in Github Actions:
| Secret | Description|
|:---------|------------|
|`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`|AWS IAM access key ID used to deploy.|
|`AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`|AWS IAM access secret used to deploy.|
|`AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`|AWS region to use.|
|`ECR_REPO`|ECR Repository which stores the docker images.|
|`BUCKET_NAME`| S3 Bucket used to store zipped `Dockerrun.aws.json`.|

There are also environment secrets for each environment (`staging`, `staging-alt`, `release`, `uat`):
| Secret | Description|
|:---------|------------|
|`APP_NAME`|Application name for the environment.|
|`DEPLOY_ENV`|Deployment environment on elastic beanstalk.|

## Environment Variables

These are configured by creating groups of environment variables formatted like `.env` files in the Parameter
Store of AWS Service Manager. These groups have names formatted as `<environment>-<category>`.

The environment for each group is user-defined, and should be specified in the Elastic Beanstalk configuration
as the environment variable `SSM_PREFIX`.

The list of categories can be inferred by looking at the file `.ebextensions/env-file-creation.config`.

#### Banners

These environment variables allow us to set notification banners in the
application without a full redeployment of the application. Note the hierarchy
of the banner content.

In addition, you can change the color of the banner by adding a type encoding in
the environment variable string. The default banner type will be `info` if no encoding is
provided.

The possible banner type prefixes are: `info:`, `warn:`, and `error:`. Other
prefixes will not work and the invalid prefixes will be shown in the banner
text.

Examples:

```
SITE_BANNER_CONTENT=info:This is an info banner. You can also add links in the text like https://example.com. There is also a dismiss button to the right of the text.
```

```

#### Rate limits at specific endpoints

The app applies per-minute, per-IP rate limits at specific API endpoints as a security measure. The limits can be specified with the following environment variables.
| Variable | Description |
| :-------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SUBMISSIONS_RATE_LIMIT` | Per-minute, per-IP request limit for each submissions endpoint. The limit is applied separately for the email mode and encrypt mode endpoints. |
| `SEND_AUTH_OTP_RATE_LIMIT` | Per-minute, per-IP request limit for the endpoint which requests for new login OTPs for the admin console or mobile / email field verifications. |

### Additional Features

The app contains a number of additional features like Captcha protection, Sentry reporting and Google Analytics. Each of these features requires specific environment variables which are detailed below.

#### Google Captcha

Forms can be protected with [recaptcha](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/about/), preventing submissions from being made by bots.

#### Google Analytics

[Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web) is used to track website traffic. Examples of events include number of visits to various forms, number of successful submissions and number of submission failures.

| Variable         | Description                   |
| :--------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `GA_TRACKING_ID` | Google Analytics tracking ID. |

| `CSP_REPORT_URI`    | Reporting URL for Content Security Policy violdations. Can be configured to use a Sentry.io endpoint. |

#### SMS with Twilio

The Mobile Number field supports form-fillers verifying their mobile numbers via a One-Time-Pin sent to their mobile phones. All messages are sent using [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) messaging APIs.

Note that verifying mobile numbers also requires the environment variables for [verified Emails/SMSes](#verified-emailssmses).

[CorpPass](https://www.corppass.gov.sg/corppass/common/aboutus) (Singapore's Digital Identity for Organizations). Forms can also be pre-filled using [MyInfo](https://www.singpass.gov.sg/myinfo/intro) after a citizen has successfully authenticated using SingPass.

Note that MyInfo is currently not supported for storage mode forms and enabling SingPass/CorpPass on storage mode forms also requires [SingPass/CorpPass for Storage Mode](#webhooks-and-singpasscorppass-for-storage-mode) to be enabled.

#### Verified Emails/SMSes

The Mobile Number and Email fields support form-fillers verifying their contact details via a One-Time-Pin.

Note that verified SMSes also require [SMS with Twilio](#sms-with-twilio) to be enabled.

| Variable                  | Description                                                    |
| :------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `VERIFICATION_SECRET_KEY` | The secret key for signing verified responses (email, mobile). |

#### Webhooks and SingPass/CorpPass for Storage Mode

Form admins can configure their Storage mode forms to POST encrypted form submissions to a REST API supplied by the form creator. The [FormSG SDK](https://github.com/opengovsg/formsg-javascript-sdk) can then be used to verify the signed posted data and decrypt the encrypted submission contained within.

These environment variables also allow Storage mode forms to support authentication via SingPass or CorpPass. Note that this also requires [SingPass/CorpPass and MyInfo](#singpasscorppass-and-myinfo) to be enabled.
