## Features

FormSG is a form builder application built, open sourced and maintained by the [Open Government Products](https://open.gov.sg) team of the Singapore [Government Technology Agency](https://tech.gov.sg) to digitise paper processes.

Notable features include:

- 19 different form field types, including attachments, tables, email and mobile
- Verified email and mobile phone fields via integrations with Twilio and AWS SES
- Automatic emailing of submissions for forms built with Email Mode
- End-to-end encryption for forms built with Storage Mode
- (Singapore government agencies only) Citizen authentication with [SingPass](https://www.singpass.gov.sg/singpass/common/aboutus)
- (Singapore government agencies only) Citizen authentication with [sgID](https://www.id.gov.sg/)
- (Singapore government agencies only) Corporate authentication with [CorpPass](https://www.corppass.gov.sg/corppass/common/aboutus)
- (Singapore government agencies only) Automatic prefill of verified data with [MyInfo](https://www.singpass.gov.sg/myinfo/common/aboutus)
- Webhooks functionality via the official [FormSG JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/opengovsg/formsg-sdk) and contributor-supported [FormSG Ruby SDK](https://github.com/opengovsg/formsg-ruby-sdk)

The current product roadmap includes:

- (in progress) Frontend rewrite from [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) to [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- Enabling payments on forms
- Electronic signatures
- Notifications to form admins for Storage mode submissions
- Integration with vault.gov.sg

## Local Development (Docker)

### Prerequisites

Install [docker and docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

### First Setup

To install the relevant npm packages, run the following in the root direcory:

```bash
npm install
```

To prevent breaking changes to webpack4 introduced in node 17 and above, enable the `--openssl-legacy-provider` flag:

```bash
export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider
```

If you are on Mac OS X, you may want to allow Docker to use more RAM (minimum of 4GB) by clicking on the Docker icon on the toolbar, clicking on the "Preferences" menu item, then clicking on the "Resources" link on the left.

### Running Locally

Run the following shell commands to build the Docker image from scratch. This will usually take 10 or so minutes. These commands runs the backend services specified under [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) and the React frontend on the native host.

```bash
npm run build:frontend
npm run dev
```

After the Docker image has finished building, the React application can be accessed at [localhost:3000](localhost:3000). The backend API server can be accessed at [localhost:5001](localhost:5001).

If there are no dependency changes in `package.json` or changes in the
`src/app/server.ts` file, you can run

```bash
docker-compose up
```

which does **not** rebuild the Docker image from scratch. This command usually
only takes ~15 seconds to finish starting up the image.

### Adding dependencies

Run `npm install` as per usual.

For backend, run

```
docker-compose up --build --renew-anon-volumes
```

which will rebuild the backend Docker image and not reuse the existing node_modules volume.

As frontend project is currently not using Docker, no other steps are required.

### Accessing email locally

We use [MailDev](https://github.com/maildev/maildev) to access emails in the development environment. The MailDev UI can be accessed at [localhost:1080](localhost:1080) when the Docker container runs.

### Environment variables

Docker-compose looks at various places for environment variables to inject into the containers.
The following is the order of priority:

- Compose file
- Shell environment variables
- Environment file
- Dockerfile

FormSG requires some environment variables to function.
More information about the required environment variables are in
[DEPLOYMENT_SETUP.md](/docs/DEPLOYMENT_SETUP.md).

We provide a [`.template-env`](./.template-env) file with the secrets blanked out. You can copy and
paste the variables described into a self-created `.env` file, replacing the
required values with your own.

### Trouble-shooting

You can consult [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](/docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for common issues that developers face and how to resolve them.

## Testing

The docker environment has not been configured to run tests. Thus, you will need
to follow the following local build guide to get tests running locally.

### Testing Prerequisites

The team uses macOS for development.

Make you sure have the following node version & package manager on your machine:

- `"node": ">=18.12.1"`
- `"npm": ">=8.19.2"`
- `"mongo": ">=4.0.0"`

Run

```bash
nvm install 18
npm install
pip install "localstack[full]"
```

to install node modules and Localstack locally to be able to run tests. Note that
`localstack[full]` is only compatible with Python 3.7 and above.

### Running tests

#### Unit tests

```bash
npm run test
```

will build the backend and run both our backend and frontend unit tests. The tests are located at
[`tests/unit/frontend`](./tests/unit/frontend) and
[`tests/unit/backend`](./tests/unit/backend).

If the backend is already built, you can run

```bash
npm run test-ci
```

#### End-to-end tests

```bash
npm run test-e2e
```

will build both the frontend and backend then run our end-to-end tests. The tests are located at [`tests/end-to-end`](./tests/end-to-end). You will need to stop the Docker dev container to be able to run the end-to-end tests.

If you do not need to rebuild the frontend and backend, you can run

```bash
npm run test-e2e-ci
```

#### Cross-browser testing

This project is tested with [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/open-source).

## Architecture

The architecture overview is [here](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## MongoDB Scripts

Scripts for common tasks in MongoDB can be found [here](docs/MONGODB.md).

## Support

Please contact FormSG (support@form.gov.sg) for any details.
