    <p>
      Please see the Schedule for more information and terms concerning this
      Service.

      Please see clause 4 (Third Party Materials) for more information.

    <p>
      3.2. Subject to these Terms of Use, GovTech grants to you a non-exclusive,
      revocable, and non-transferable right to access and use the Service for

      redistribute or sublicense the Service or any part of the Service without
      the prior written consent of GovTech or the respective third party owners.
      You also shall not use the Service in violation of any applicable laws or

      rights to the Service not specifically granted herein are expressly
      reserved to GovTech.

        you may have downloaded.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      3.4. You will not interfere or attempt to interfere with the proper
      working of the Service or otherwise do anything that imposes an
      unreasonable or disproportionately large load on GovTech’s servers.
    </p>

    <br />
    <p class="static-view-title">3A. Account Access and Security</p>

    <p>
      3A.1 You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and
      security of any authentication credentials associated with your use of the
      Service, including the security of any of your devices which store the
      authentication credentials.
    </p>

    <p>
      3A.2 GovTech shall be entitled, but not obliged, to verify the identity of
      the person using the Service. Without prejudice to the foregoing, GovTech
      is not under any duty to verify that any biometric identifier used with
      the Service, or on your device, belongs to you.
    </p>

    <p>
      3A.3 GovTech shall have the sole and absolute discretion to invalidate any
      authentication credentials at any time, or require you to have to
      re-authenticate or refresh your authentication credentials at any time,
      without having to give any reason for the same.
    </p>

    <p>
      3A.4 GovTech shall be entitled, but not obliged, to act upon or rely on
      any instructions, information, transmissions of data, or communications
      received from the account or use of the Service in relation to your
      authentication credentials, as if such instructions, information, data or
      communications were issued by you, whether or not the same was authorized
      by you.
    </p>

    <p>
      3A.5 For the avoidance of doubt, you are solely responsible for any loss
      of whatever nature arising from unauthorized or unofficial modifications
      made to your device which permit or escalate privileged access, or remove
      restrictions to such access, which are not intended by the manufacturer or
      provider of your device or operating system of your device (e.g.,
      "rooting" or "jailbreaking" your mobile phone).
    </p>

    <br />
    <p class="static-view-title">4. Third Party Materials</p>

    <p>
      4.1. The Service may require, enable or facilitate access to or use of
      software or services of a third party ("<b>Third Party</b>"). In such an
      event, there may be terms of use of the third party software or service
      (the "<b>Third Party Terms</b>"). GovTech may be required under or as a
      result of the Third Party Terms to notify you of certain terms that apply
      to you (either directly as an end user, or as a party whose acts or
      omissions could cause GovTech to breach the Third Party Terms) when you
      use the Services. An example of Third Party Terms may be open source
      software terms or standard form terms of the distribution platform from
      which you obtain any part of the Service (e.g. Google Play Store or Apple
      App Store terms) which bind GovTech as a developer or user of the
      distribution platform (the "<b>Distribution Terms</b>"). Information on
      the Third Party Terms are embedded in the Service, already accounted for
      in these Terms of Use, publicly available (e.g the Distribution Terms) or
      otherwise listed in the Schedule herein. For the avoidance of doubt,
      insofar as this Clause 4 relates to the Distribution Terms, the relevant
      Distribution Terms are the terms of the specific platform from which you
      obtained a copy of the software or application that is part of the
      Service. For example, if you obtained the said copy from the Google Play
      Store, then the relevant terms are Google’s Distribution Terms.
    </p>

    <p>
      4.2.
      <b
        >It is your responsibility to check and read the most up-to-date
        versions of these Third Party Terms and you are deemed to have notice of
        the same.</b
      >
      In particular, you are deemed to have notice of the Third Party Terms that
      GovTech (under the Third Party Terms) is required to notify you, and you
      unconditionally agree to be bound by all the obligations in the Third
      Party Terms which are applicable to you as the end user.
    </p>

    <p>
      4.3. If the Third Party Terms require you to enter into an agreement
      directly with the Third Party, then you unconditionally agree to enter
      into such agreement, and in any event, to be legally bound by the Third
      Party Terms. For the avoidance of doubt:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        4.3.1. some Third Party Terms (particularly open-source terms) permit
        either a direct licence to you from the Third Party or a sublicence from
        GovTech to you. In such cases, your licence is a direct licence from the
        Third Party to you; and
      </li>
      <li>
        4.3.2. the terms of your agreement with the Third Party will govern your
        use of the relevant third party software or service, and not these Terms
        of Use.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      4.4. If the Third Party Terms expressly or impliedly require GovTech to
      incorporate certain terms in these Terms of Use (inclusive of terms which
      impose any minimum or maximum standards herein, and/or terms described in
      Clause 4.5 below), such terms are deemed to have been so incorporated (the
      "<b>Incorporated Terms</b>"). Examples of Incorporated Terms include
      provisions which require GovTech to give you notice of certain rights and
      liabilities or require GovTech to ensure that you acknowledge certain
      matters. Similarly, if the Third Party Terms expressly or impliedly
      require these Terms of Use to be altered such that the Third Party Terms
      are complied with, the parties herein agree that the Terms of Use shall be
      deemed to be so altered but only to the extent necessary for compliance.
    </p>

    <p>
      4.5. Some Third Party Terms grant the Third Party, or require GovTech to
      grant the Third Party, direct rights of enforcement of these Terms of Use
      as a third party beneficiary, against you. Such Third Party Terms are
      deemed to have been incorporated into these Terms of Use as Incorporated
      Terms, and you hereby agree to grant such Third Party, such direct rights
      of enforcement against you.
    </p>

    <p>
      4.6. For the avoidance of doubt, without prejudice to Clause 4.4, to the
      extent of any inconsistency between these Terms of Use and the Third Party
      Terms, the latter shall prevail provided nothing in the Third Party Terms
      increases the liability of GovTech beyond that stated in Clause 6.
    </p>

    <br />
    <p class="static-view-title">
      5. Your Consent to Access Functions of Your Device
    </p>
    <p>
      Use of the Service may require you to allow access by the Service to
      certain functions of your device, such as push notifications, the
      obtaining and/or sharing of your location, or the collection of data from
      you in connection with the Service. Please also see clause 8 (Privacy
      Policy). Your use of the Service shall constitute your consent to the
      access by the Service of such functions of your device as may be
      reasonably required by the Service.
    </p>

    <br />
    <p class="static-view-title">
      5A. Ownership of Feedback/Requests/Suggestions
    </p>

    <p>
      You agree that all title and interest in any feedback, requests or
      suggestions from you concerning the Services shall be owned by GovTech.
    </p>

    <br />
    <p class="static-view-title">5B. Confidentiality</p>

    <p>
      5B.1 If you receive information or data (in whatever form) from GovTech or
      a Third Party which is designated confidential or proprietary or is
      otherwise reasonably understood to be confidential or proprietary
      (collectively,
      <b>"Confidential Information"</b>), you shall not use, disclose or
      reproduce the Confidential Information except for the purpose for which it
      was provided to you. If consent to disclose the Confidential Information
      to a third party is given by GovTech or the Third Party to you, any act or
      omission in respect of the Confidential Information by that person shall
      be deemed to be your act or omission and you agree to be fully liable for
      the same. In all cases, you shall protect the Confidential Information to
      the same extent you protect your own confidential information but in no
      event less than a reasonable standard of care. You shall ensure that any
      recipients are bound by confidentiality terms at least as restrictive as
      this Clause.
    </p>

    <p>
      5B.2 You shall destroy any Confidential Information immediately upon
      request by GovTech or the Third Party.
    </p>

    <p>5B.3 In the event:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        5B.3.1 you are, or likely to be, required by an order of court to
        disclose Confidential Information; or
      </li>
      <li>
        5B.3.2 you have reasonable grounds to suspect the unauthorised use or
        disclosure or reproduction of Confidential Information;
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      you shall immediately notify GovTech or the Third Party of the same and
      cooperate with GovTech or the Third Party to prevent or limit such
      disclosure.
    </p>

    <p>
      5B.4 Nothing in this Clause 5B shall prejudice GovTech's or the Third
      Party's other rights at law.
    </p>

    <br />
    <p class="static-view-title">6. Disclaimers and Indemnity</p>

    <p>
      6.1. The Service is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis

    </ul>

    <p>
      6.2. GovTech shall also not be liable to you or any third party for any
      damage or loss of any kind whatsoever and howsoever caused, including but
      not limited to any direct or indirect, special or consequential damages,
      loss of income, revenue or profits, lost or damaged data, or damage to
      your computer, software or any other property, whether arising directly or
      indirectly from –
    </p>

      <li>
        6.2.1. your access to or use of this Service, or any part thereof;
      </li>
      <li>
        6.2.2. any loss of access to our use of this Service or any part of this

    <p>
      regardless of whether GovTech has been advised of the possibility of such
      damage or loss.
    </p>

    <p>
      6.3. Without prejudice and in addition to the foregoing, insofar as the
      Service facilitates or requires the provision, use or functioning of, or
      is provided in conjunction with, other products, software, materials
      and/or services not provided by GovTech, GovTech makes no representation
      or warranty in relation to such products, software, materials and/or
      services (including without limitation any representation or warranties as
      to timeliness, reliability, availability, interoperability, quality,
      fitness for purpose, non-infringement, suitability or accuracy).
    </p>

    <p>
      6.4. You shall not rely on any part of the Service to claim or assert any
      form of legitimate expectation against GovTech, whether or not arising out
      of or in connection with GovTech’s roles and functions as a public
      authority.
    </p>

    <p>
      6.5. You agree to defend and indemnify and keep GovTech and its officers,
      employees, agents and contractors harmless against all liabilities,
      losses, damages, costs or expenses (including legal costs on an indemnity
      basis) howsoever arising out of or in connection with your access or use
      of the Service (including third party software or services) or your
      non-compliance with the Terms of Use, Third Party Terms or Incorporated
      Terms, whether or not you had been advised or informed of the nature or
      extent of such liabilities, losses, damages, costs or expenses. You
      warrant and represent that your access or use of the Service does not and
      will not breach or violate any laws, regulations, trade, economic and/or
      export sanctions (wherever in the world) applicable to you, and that you
      shall not transmit any malicious code, illegal, infringing or undesirable
      content or materials to GovTech or its agents or any Third Party.
    </p>

    <br />
    <p class="static-view-title">7. Hyperlinks</p>

    <p>
      7.1. Insofar as the Service provides a hyperlink to material not
      maintained or controlled by GovTech, GovTech shall not be responsible for
      the content of the hyperlinked material and shall not be liable for any
      damages or loss arising from access to the hyperlinked material. Use of
      the hyperlinks and access to such hyperlinked materials are entirely at
      your own risk. The hyperlinks are provided merely as a convenience to you
      and do not imply endorsement by, association or affiliation with GovTech
      of the contents of or provider of the hyperlinked materials.
    </p>

    <p>
      7.2. Caching and hyperlinking to, and the framing of, any part of the
      Service is prohibited save where you have obtained GovTech’s prior written
      consent. Such consent may be subject to any conditions as may be
      determined by GovTech in its sole discretion. If you hyperlink to or frame
      any part of the Service, that shall constitute your acceptance of these
      Terms of Use and all amendments thereto. If you do not accept these Terms
      of Use as may be amended from time to time, you must immediately
      discontinue linking to or framing of any part of the Service.
    </p>

    <p>7.3. GovTech reserves all rights:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        7.3.1. to disable any links to, or frames of, any materials which are
        unauthorised (including without limitation materials which imply
        endorsement by or association or affiliation with GovTech, materials
        containing inappropriate, profane, defamatory, infringing, obscene,
        indecent or unlawful topics, names, or information that violates any
        written law, any applicable intellectual property, proprietary, privacy
        or publicity rights); and
      </li>
      <li>
        7.3.2. to disclaim responsibility and/or liability for materials that
        link to or frame any part of the Service.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <br />
    <p class="static-view-title">8. Privacy Policy</p>
    <p>
      You also agree to the terms of the Privacy Policy for this Service as may
      be amended from time to time. The Privacy Policy will form part of these
      Terms of Use.
    </p>

    <br />
    <p class="static-view-title">9. Rights of Third Parties</p>
    <p>
      Subject to the rights of the Third Party, a person who is not a party to
      this Terms of Use shall have no right under the Contract (Rights of Third
      Parties) Act or otherwise to enforce any of its terms.
    </p>

    <br />
    <p class="static-view-title">10. Assignment</p>

    <p>
      10.1. You may not assign or sub-contract this Terms of Use without the
      prior written consent of GovTech.
    </p>

    <p>
      10.2. GovTech may assign, novate, transfer, or sub-contract the rights and
      liabilities in respect of the Service and this Terms of Use, without
      notifying you and without further reference to you. Your acceptance of
      this Terms of Use shall also constitute your consent to such assignment,
      novation, transfer or sub-contract.
    </p>

    <br />
    <p class="static-view-title">10A. Severability</p>

    <p>
      If any term of these Terms of Use is held by a court or tribunal of
      competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, then these Terms of
      Use, including all of the remaining terms, will remain in full force and
      effect as if such invalid or unenforceable term had never been included
      but, to the extent permissible, such invalid or unenforceable terms shall
      be deemed to have been replaced by terms that are (a) valid and
      enforceable and (b) express the intention or produce the result closest to
      the original intention of the invalid or unenforceable terms.
    </p>

    <br />
    <p class="static-view-title">11. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</p>

    <p>
      11.1. These Terms of Use shall be governed by and construed in accordance
      with laws of Singapore.
    </p>

    <p>
      11.2. Subject to clause 11.3, any dispute arising out of or in connection
      with these Terms of Use, including any question regarding its existence,
      validity or termination, shall be referred to and finally resolved in the
      Courts of the Republic of Singapore and the parties hereby submit to the
      exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts of the Republic of Singapore.
    </p>

    <p>
      11.3. GovTech may, at its sole discretion, refer any dispute referred to
      in clause 11.2 above to arbitration administered by the Singapore
      International Arbitration Centre ("<b>SIAC</b>") in Singapore in
      accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the SIAC ("<b>SIAC Rules</b>")
      for the time being in force, which rules are deemed to be incorporated by
      reference in this clause. Further:

    <ul>
      <li>11.3.1. The seat of the arbitration shall be Singapore.</li>
      <li>11.3.2. The tribunal shall consist of one (1) arbitrator.</li>

        relating to the arbitration shall be confidential.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Where GovTech is the defendant or respondent, it shall be given at least
      30 days before the commencement of any legal action against it to elect to
      exercise the right herein to have the dispute submitted to arbitration.
      This right to elect shall not prejudice GovTech’s right to a limitation
      defence and the period to exercise the right shall not be abridged by
      reason of any accrual of a limitation defence in favour of GovTech during
      the said period.
