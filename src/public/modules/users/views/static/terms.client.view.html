              an end user, or as a party whose acts or omissions could cause
              GovTech to breach the Third Party Terms) when you use the
              Services. An example of Third Party Terms may be open source

              from which you obtain any part of the Service (e.g. Google Play

              Clause 4 relates to the Distribution Terms, the relevant
              Distribution Terms are the terms of the specific platform from
              which you obtained a copy of the software or application that is
              part of the Service. For example, if you obtained the said copy
              from the Google Play Store, then the relevant terms are Google’s
