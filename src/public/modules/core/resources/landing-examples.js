We also love the logic feature which has gotten us creative in designing forms with customised view for our Team Nila volunteers.

My colleagues and I are able to build customized forms that are able to meet the various needs of my branch. One big plus point is that the form responses are sent in the form of emails to only intended recipients – thus making the data collected very secure. Thank you, Form.sg!',

Although the product is not all-encompassing compared to other digital form platforms out in the market, Form.sg edges out its competitors in one main and critical aspect: security. Having to interface with multiple internal and external stakeholders, data security is of paramount importance and thus far, Form.sg is most effective when we used it for workshops, surveys, registration for programmes, and collation of personal particulars.',

We use it to collect data from the public, from students and from colleagues for a variety of applications, while still meeting IM8 requirements on personal data protection. The scripts and templates are easy to use and customisable and the option to integrate this with a Shared CES Inbox streamlines processes for our School Admin Team and teachers. With one click, we can aggregate the data into the format in that we need. It’s all done in less than a minute. We’ve also shared this with several other schools and they are very keen to use it too. Great job, GovTech!',
