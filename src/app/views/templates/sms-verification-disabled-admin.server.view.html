    <p>Dear form admin(s),</p>
    <p>
      You are receiving this as you have enabled SMS OTP verification on a
      Mobile Number field of your form:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <% forms.forEach(function({title, link}) { %>
      <li><a href="<%= link %>"> <%= title %> </a>.</li>
      <% }) %>
    </ol>
    <p>
      SMS OTP verification has been <b>automatically disabled</b> on your form
      as you have reached the free tier limit of <%= smsVerificationLimit %>
      responses.
    </p>

    <p>
      We would have previously notified all form admins upon your account
      reaching <%= smsWarningTiers.LOW %>, <%= smsWarningTiers.MED %> and <%=
      smsWarningTiers.HIGH %> responses while free SMS OTP verification was
      enabled.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you require SMS OTP verification for more than <%= smsVerificationLimit
      %> responses, please
