    <p>Dear form admin,</p>
    <p>
      You own forms with free SMS OTP verification on a Mobile Number field:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <% forms.forEach(function({title, link}) { %>
      <li><a href="<%= link %>"> <%= title %> </a></li>
      <% }) %>
    </ol>
    <p>
      <b>
        As you have reached the free tier limit of <%= smsVerificationLimit %>
        per account, SMS OTP verification has been automatically disabled on all
        forms you own.
      </b>
      Respondents will still be able to submit to your form(s) but will not be
      prompted to verify their mobile numbers.
    </p>

    <p>
      We would have previously notified all form admins upon your account
      reaching <%= smsWarningTiers.LOW %>, <%= smsWarningTiers.MED %> and <%=
      smsWarningTiers.HIGH %> free verifications.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you need to send more SMS OTP verifications, please
