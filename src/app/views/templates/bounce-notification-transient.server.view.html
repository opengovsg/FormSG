    <p>Dear form admin(s),</p>
    <p>
      We are contacting you urgently because your FormSG form '<%= formTitle %>'
      (<%= formLink %>) has responses that were unable to be delivered to the
      following recipients: <%= bouncedRecipients %>.
    </p>
    <p>This bounce was likely due to a full mailbox.</p>
    <p><strong>What to do immediately</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Check if <%= bouncedRecipients %> have full mailboxes. If so, free up
        capacity immediately (e.g. by archiving old emails).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Add a valid email address with spare inbox capacity</strong> to
        your form’s email recipients, under Settings > ‘Emails where responses
        will be sent’.
      </li>
      <li>
        Submit a test response on your form, and check that you receive it.
      </li>
      <li>
        Consider switching your form to Storage mode, or

        which automates clearing of mailbox capacity (see
        <strong>Preventing future response loss</strong> below).
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Preventing future response loss</strong></p>
    <p>
      Due to the risk of <strong>permanent response loss</strong> from bounced
      emails, we
      <strong>strongly recommend users use Storage mode</strong> whenever
      possible. Note that Storage mode does not support MyInfo and emailed pdf
      responses; for these features you will have to use Email mode.
    </p>
    <p><u>Option 1: Storage mode</u></p>
    <p>
      Under Storage mode, responses will not be sent to your email but are
      downloadable as a spreadsheet from FormSG’s website.

        >, which you will need to access responses. Responses cannot be
        recovered if this key is lost.

    </ul>
    <p><u>Option 2: Email mode with precautions</u></p>
    <p>If you must use Email mode,</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Specify 2 or more email recipients for your Email mode forms in
        Settings, to increase the chance of responses getting delivered to at
        least one recipient.

    <p><strong>Recovering bounced responses</strong></p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, once a response has bounced from your mailbox, FormSG is
      not able to recover the response for you as we do not store response data.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, if you had listed another email recipient in Settings, the
      response may have been successfully sent to them.
