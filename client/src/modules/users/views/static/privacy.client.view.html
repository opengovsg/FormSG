      Privacy Policy
    </h2>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy must be read in conjunction with the Terms of Use that
      accompany the applicable service you are requesting from us (the
      <b>"Service"</b>). If you are a form respondent, this Privacy Policy will
      also apply in addition to any other privacy policy that the form creator
      provides to you as part of the form. In this Privacy Policy,
      <b>"Public Sector Entities"</b> means the Government (including its
      ministries, departments and organs of state) and public authorities (such
      as statutory boards) and "personal data" shall have the same meaning as
      its definition in the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (No. 26 of 2012).

            of users and their frequency of use, profiles of users and their
            preferred sites. While this cookie can tell us when you enter our
            sites and which pages you visit, it cannot read data off your hard
