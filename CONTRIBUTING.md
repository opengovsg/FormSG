Before submitting bug reports or feature request, please check [existing or past issues](https://go.gov.sg/formsg-issues) and [existing or past pull requests](https://go.gov.sg/formsg-pulls).
You might find out that you don't need to create one.

## Making a pull request

Issues available to be picked up by the community are labeled with `contribute`.

If you're submitting a pull request, some points to note:

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build. Refer to [README.md](https://go.gov.sg/formsg-readme) for more details
2. Update the [README.md](https://go.gov.sg/formsg-readme) with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
<!---Increase the version numbers of the packages in any example files and the [README.md](https://github.com/opengovsg/formsg/blob/master/README.md) to the new version that this Pull Request would represent.--->
3. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.
