# Contributing to FormSG

Welcome to FormSG! The following are guidelines for contribution. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in an issue.

## Getting started

To contribute, you can start by taking a look at our open issues marked 'contribute' under GitHub's 'Issues' tab. Feel free to assign yourself to any 'contribute' issue that interests you, and comment with questions or clarifications. 

Otherwise, please **first discuss the change you wish to make via GitHub issue**, [email](mailto:support@form.gov.sg), or any other method with the repository owners beforehand.

## Security reports

Please do not file an open issue for ongoing security bugs. Instead, email us directly with your findings at [support@form.gov.sg](mailto:support@form.gov.sg).

## Bug reports and feature requests

The following guidelines help maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

Before submitting bug reports or feature request, please check our [issues](https://go.gov.sg/formsg-issues) and [PRs](https://github.com/opengovsg/FormSG/pulls).
You might find out that you don't need to create one.

When **submitting a bug report**, please include as many details as possible, such as the steps to reproduce this bug, expected and actual behaviour.

When **submitting a feature request**, please include the motivation, alternatives that you've considered and any additional contexts that could help us better understand your goal.

Here are some tips to writing good issues:

- **Use a clear and descriptive title** to identify the problem
- **Describe the exact steps to reproduce the problem** and **explain how you did it**
- **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**
- **Include screenshots or animated GIFs if you can**
- **Explain why this new feature would be useful**

## Making a pull request

Issues available to be picked up by the community are labeled with `contribute`.

If you're submitting a pull request, some points to note:

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build. Refer to [README.md](https://go.gov.sg/formsg-readme) for more details
2. Update the [README.md](https://go.gov.sg/formsg-readme) with details of changes to the interface, including new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
<!---Increase the version numbers of the packages in any example files and the [README.md](https://github.com/opengovsg/formsg/blob/master/README.md) to the new version that this Pull Request would represent.--->
3. Write [semantic commit messages](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). See past [PRs](https://github.com/opengovsg/FormSG/pulls) for examples. 
4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.
