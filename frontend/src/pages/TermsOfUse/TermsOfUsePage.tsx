                    as a result of the Third Party Terms to notify you of
                    certain terms that apply to you (either directly as an end

                    GovTech to breach the Third Party Terms) when you use the
                    Services. An example of Third Party Terms may be open source
                    software terms or standard form terms of the distribution
                    platform from which you obtain any part of the Service (e.g.

                    GovTech as a developer or user of the distribution platform
                    (the ‚Äú<b>Distribution Terms</b>‚Äù). Information on the Third
                    Party Terms are embedded in the Service, already accounted
                    for in these Terms of Use, publicly available (e.g the

                    obtained a copy of the software or application that is part
